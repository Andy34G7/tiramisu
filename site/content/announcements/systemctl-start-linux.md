Why do those who use Linux swear by it so much?
What's so special about Linux that enables it to power most of the world's servers?
What does infinite customizability really mean?

`systemctl start linux` is a beginner-oriented, hands-on workshop by Hackerspace PESUECC that aims to answer these questions for you. Join us, as we guide you on your Linux journey.

**This workshop will be held on the 18th of April, 2022 from 4:00 to 6:00 PM at the Seminar Hall, PESU EC Campus.**
